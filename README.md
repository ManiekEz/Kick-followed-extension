# Kick-followed-extension
Browser sidebar extension that displays a list of Kick streamers you follow, directly in your browser.
Designed primarily for Opera GX, this project was inspired by the built-in Twitch sidebar extension and created as a personal learning exercise to improve my JavaScript skills.

## Features
  - See which streamers you follow are currently live.
  - Clean and simple interface.
